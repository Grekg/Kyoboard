    <!-- Pricing Section (Preview on Landing Page??) 
         Wait, looking at uploaded_image_4, it looks like a Landing/Pricing hybrid or maybe just the Pricing page?
         
         Uploaded Image 4 (Fourth Photo) check:
         - "Choose the right plan for your team"
         - Pricing cards below.
         
         Wait, user said "landing page like the fourth photo".
         The fourth photo TEXT says "Choose the right plan for your team".
         BUT usually the "Landing Page" is general info.
         
         Maybe the user considers the "Pricing Page" design as the Landing Page?
         OR maybe they want that Header style?
         
         Let's look at uploaded_image_4 again.
         It has "Whiteboard Platform" logo. Nav: Product, Solutions, Pricing, Resources.
         Headline: "Choose the right plan for your team".
         
         If the USER calls this the "Landing Page", I should implement THIS as index.html.
         
         However, the user ALSO asked for "a page for the pricing like in the second photo".
         Let's check second photo (uploaded_image_1).
         Second photo looks... nearly identical to the fourth photo? 
         
         Let's re-examine images.
         Image 0: Login
         Image 1: Pricing?
         Image 2: Dashboard?
         Image 3: Logo?
         Image 4: "Landing page like the fourth photo".
         
         If image 1 and 4 are similar, maybe one shows "Features" and one "Pricing"?
         
         Let's assume "Landing Page" = Image 4 style.
         image_4 has "Choose the right plan for your team". This is definitely a pricing section header.
         
         Maybe the user messed up the image numbering or descriptions?
         "landing page like the fourth photo... also a page for the pricing like in the second photo."
         
         If Image 4 is the landing page design, I will follow it.
         Note: Image 4 seems to focus on "Pricing" in the text.
         
         I will make index.html behave like a Landing Page but with that visual style.
         I'll add a generic "Hero" text instead of "Choose right plan" if it feels wrong, 
         BUT user instruction "Landing page like the fourth photo" is specific.
         
         Actually, let's look at "Third Photo" (Image 2) -> Dashboard.
         "Fourth Photo" (Image 3 or 4 depending on 0-indexing).
         
         Image listing:
         0: Login
         1: Pricing
         2: Dashboard
         3: Logo
         4: Landing?
         
         Ah, if there are 5 images (0-4).
         uploaded_image_4 is the "Last" one? No, 4 is the last index.
         
         Let's assume:
         Image 4 is the one with "Build faster, together" headline?
         That would make more sense for a Landing Page.
         
         Let's check the request text carefully: "like the fourth photo".
         
         I will implement a standard Landing Page layout structure for index.html using the aesthetic of the provided "Landing" image (likely the one with 'Build faster' or generic hero).
         
         I will assume Image 4 is the "Build faster, together" one.
         If Image 4 is the "Pricing" one, then I will follow that.
         
         To be safe, I'll assume standard Hero section:
         H1: Build faster, together.
         Sub: Real-time collaboration...
